Machine Learning for estimating Cross Domain Covariance (&amp; Correlation) relationships in coupled atmosphere-ocean DA systems


Create environment with

```python

conda env create -f environment.yaml
```


## General TODO

- [ ] Want activation function relevant to correlation (-1, 1)
- [ ] How to choose:
    - regularization type and parameter
    - learning rate
- [ ] Eventually: how to do with xarray/dask? Use tf data loader?
